### **1. Information Storage Basics**
   - **Data vs. Information**: Data is raw facts; information is processed data.
   - **Types of Data**:
     - Structured (10%) - Databases.
     - Unstructured (90%) - Images, emails, PDFs, etc.
   - **Big Data**: Requires advanced tools for real-time analysis and decision-making.

### **2. Storage System Evolution**
   - **Server-Centric**: Storage tied to individual servers; hard to share and manage.
   - **Information-Centric**: Centralized storage, accessible by multiple servers, more efficient.

### **3. Data Center Core Elements**
   - **Components**:
     - **Application** - Software providing operations.
     - **DBMS** - Manages data in structured tables.
     - **Host/Compute** - Runs applications.
     - **Network** - Connects data and resources.
     - **Storage** - Persistent data storage.
   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - **Availability** - Data should be accessible when needed.
     - **Security** - Protection against unauthorized access.
     - **Scalability** - Adjust resources with growth.
     - **Performance** - Optimal function of elements.
     - **Data Integrity** - Reliable, accurate data storage.
     - **Capacity** - Handle data volume as it grows.
     - **Manageability** - Easy monitoring and resource management.

### **4. Virtualization and Cloud Computing**
   - **Virtualization**: Turns physical resources into flexible, logical resources, maximizing usage.
   - **Cloud Computing**: Provides on-demand IT resources with scalable, pay-per-use model.

### **5. Summary Points for Review**
   - Understand data types, storage evolution, and data center essentials.
   - Recognize the benefits of virtualization and cloud computing.
