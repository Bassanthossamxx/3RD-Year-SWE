# Information Storage and Management

---

## 1. Information Storage Basics

- **Data vs. Information**: 
  - *Data* refers to raw facts.
  - *Information* is processed data with meaning.

- **Factors Driving Digital Data Growth**:
  - Increased data-processing capabilities
  - Lower costs of digital storage
  - Affordable and faster communication technologies
  - Growth of applications and smart devices

- **Types of Data**:
  - **Structured (10%)**: Databases
  - **Unstructured (90%)**: Images, emails, PDFs, etc.

- **Big Data**:
  - Requires advanced tools for real-time analysis.
  - Key capabilities include:
    - High performance
    - Massively parallel processing (MPP) platforms
    - Advanced analytics

- **Storage Devices Examples**:
  - Media cards (phones, cameras)
  - DVDs, CD-ROMs
  - Disk drives, Disk arrays
  - Tapes

## 2. Storage System Evolution

- **Server-Centric**: Storage is tied to individual servers, making it difficult to share and manage.
- **Information-Centric**: Centralized storage, accessible by multiple servers for greater efficiency.

## 3. Data Center Core Elements

### What is a Data Center?
A facility containing storage, compute, network, and other IT resources, providing centralized data-processing capabilities.

- **Core Components**:
  - **Application**: Provides operations and logic.
  - **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Manages data in structured tables.
  - **Host/Compute**: Platform running applications.
  - **Network**: Connects data and resources.
  - **Storage**: Persistent data storage.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Availability**: Ensures data is accessible when needed.
  - **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access.
  - **Scalability**: Expands resources as needs grow.
  - **Performance**: Ensures optimal function of elements.
  - **Data Integrity**: Guarantees accurate data storage.
  - **Capacity**: Handles increasing data volume.
  - **Manageability**: Simplifies monitoring and management.

## 4. Managing a Data Center

- **Monitoring**: Continuously gather information on data center elements and services.
- **Reporting**: Provides details on resource performance, capacity, and usage.
- **Provisioning**: Configures and allocates resources to meet requirements in capacity, availability, performance, and security.

## 5. Virtualization and Cloud Computing

- **Virtualization**: Abstracts physical resources to create flexible, logical resources, maximizing efficiency.
- **Cloud Computing**: Provides scalable, on-demand IT resources with a pay-per-use model.
